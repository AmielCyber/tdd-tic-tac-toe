# tdd-tic-tac-toe

## Description

To celebrate my first year using React, I build a Tic-Tac-Toe based on the first project I ever did with React.
This project is a test driven development using React Testing Library and Jest. Unlike the first project, this
project has better styling and many other features mentioned below.
